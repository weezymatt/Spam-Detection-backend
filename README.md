This machine learning (ML) project was created for the purpose of deploying a ML-based API model by using the cloud provider Render to set up the environment and host the docker container. The swagger documentation of the API is available [here](https://spam-detection-e9se.onrender.com/docs) for viewing.

## Objective
The objective of this tutorial is to build a prediction model that will accurately classify which texts are spam using the FastAPI framework.
